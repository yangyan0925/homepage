<h1 id="about-me"></h1>

<h2 style="margin: 80px 0px 10px;"></h2>

I am a postdoctoral researcher in the the [Institute for Chinese Studies](https://www.geschkult.fu-berlin.de/e/oas/sinologie/index.html) at the [Freie Universit√§t Berlin](https://www.fu-berlin.de/).

My research focuses on **public administration**, **public policy**, and **comparative politics**. Currently, my research interests include agenda-setting, political propaganda, and digital politics. I am currently conducting research on the implementation and impact of the "Digital China" strategy at the local level and investigatiing the political communication of the Chinese Communist Party in the digital era. I am also interested in interdisciplinary topics at the intersection of political science and public administration, such as China's elite politics, bureaucracy, and environmental governance.

Previously, I earned my Ph.D. in Management Science and Engineering from [Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications (BUPT)](https://www.bupt.edu.cn/) in July 2021 and served as a postdoctoral fellow at the [School of Public Policy and Management, Tsinghua University](https://www.sppm.tsinghua.edu.cn/), from 2021 to 2023. You can find my CV here: [CV_YangYAN](./assets/file/CV_YangYAN202411.pdf).

My work has been published or is forthcoming in peer-reviewed journals such as *Comparative Politics*, *Administration & Society*, *Journal of Comparative Policy Analysis*, *Journal of Contemporary China*, and *China: An International Journal*.
