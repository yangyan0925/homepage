<h1 id="about-me"></h1>

<h2 style="margin: 80px 0px 10px;"></h2>

I am a postdoctoral researcher in the [Institute for Chinese Studies](https://www.geschkult.fu-berlin.de/e/oas/sinologie/index.html) at the [Freie Universität Berlin](https://www.fu-berlin.de/) and a core member of [Prof. Dr. Genia Kostka](https://www.geschkult.fu-berlin.de/e/oas/sinologie/institut/mitarbeiter/1_professoren/Kostka.html)’s ERC-funded project, [Digital Governance in China](https://www.digitalgovernancechina.eu/).

My research lies at the intersection of public administration and comparative politics, with a particular focus on **agenda-setting**, **political propaganda**, and **digital politics**. Currently, I am exploring the implementation and impact of the “Digital China (数字中国)” strategy and examining how the Chinese Communist Party navigates political communication in the digital era. I am also interested in elite politics, bureaucratic dynamics, and environmental governance in contemporary China.

My work has been published or is forthcoming in peer-reviewed journals such as *Comparative Politics*, *Administration & Society*, *Journal of Comparative Policy Analysis*, *Journal of Contemporary China*, and *China: An International Journal*.

Previously, I earned my Ph.D. in Management Science and Engineering from [Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications (BUPT)](https://www.bupt.edu.cn/) in July 2021 and served as a postdoctoral fellow at the [School of Public Policy and Management, Tsinghua University](https://www.sppm.tsinghua.edu.cn/), from 2021 to 2023.
